The project you can see is the simpliest version of a console snake game.
Once you download the application and run it via Program.exe you can see down the folder,
you will be able to play it.

All you need is a working keyboard which arrows on it to control the snake.
Use LEFT, RIGHT, UP AND DOWN arrows to control the snake in the appropriate directions.
Try to avoid all the walls and eat as many "*" as its possible!
Once you lose, you will be able to restart the game and keep on grinding!

We will be trying to improve our game in the future so check for more updates.

Have fun!
